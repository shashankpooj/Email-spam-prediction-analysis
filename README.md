# Spam-Ham Classifier using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Python script to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam) using Logistic Regression. It utilizes the `sklearn` library for text processing and classification tasks.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/spam-ham-classifier.git
   cd spam-ham-classifier
   ```

2. Place your dataset (`mail_data.csv`) containing 'Message' and 'Category' columns (spam or ham) in the root directory.

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python spam_ham_classifier.py
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy on both training and test datasets.
   - Provide a prediction for a sample email text.

## Script Explanation

- **Loading Data**: Loads the email dataset from `mail_data.csv`.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans the data by handling null values and categorizing emails as spam (0) or ham (1).
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts text data into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Logistic Regression model on the training set.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's accuracy on both training and test sets.
- **Prediction**: Provides a prediction on a sample email text.

Feel free to modify the script or dataset to suit your needs!
